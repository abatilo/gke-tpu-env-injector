Create a StatefulSet where both the StatefulSet itself has an annotation of
`gke-tpu-env-injector.aaronbatilo.dev/inject: enabled`. This will inject the
`TPU_WORKER_HOSTNAMES` environment variable across all of the pods in the
StatefulSet.

Additionally, make sure to add the same
`gke-tpu-env-injector.aaronbatilo.dev/inject: enabled` annotation at the Pod
template level. This will inject the `TPU_WORKER_ID` with each Pod's ordinal
index as the worker ID.
